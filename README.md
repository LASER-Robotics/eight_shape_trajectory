# The LASER 8-shape Trajectory Generator

This repository contains a code to generate 8-shape trajectories for evaluating control algorithms.

## Quickstart

Run the code inside the [Python notebook](notebook/8_shape_trajectory_generator.ipynb) to get a file with the desired path. We strongly recommend running this on the [Google Colab website](https://colab.research.google.com/) since you only need the output file.

## Usage

You can find usage examples in the [Python notebook](notebook/8_shape_trajectory_generator.ipynb).

## Contributions and future works

We already have a few improvements in mind:

* Generate a .yaml file to direct load the path through Robot Operating System (ROS) parameters.
