# The LASER 8-shape Trajectory Generator

This repository contains a code to generate 8-shape trajectories for evaluating control algorithms. You run the Python code inside the [notebook](notebook) to get a file with the desired path.

## Quickstart

We strongly recommend running this code on the [Google Colab website](https://colab.research.google.com/) since you only need the output file.

## Usage

You can find usage examples in the [notebook](notebook).

## Contributions and future works

We already have a few improvements in mind:

* Generate a .yaml file to direct load the path through Robot Operating System (ROS) parameters.
